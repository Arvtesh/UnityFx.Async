TODO:
1) IProgress support:
	- add support for automatic progress reporting to operatino chains;
	- the progress reporting implementation should be overridable/extendable;
	- progress reporting should support standard IProgress interface;
2) Optimize number of allocations needed for adding continuations:
	- most common case is a 1-2 continuations per operation;
	- it's a very rare case when more than 4 continuations per operation is needed, so this case is not a subject to any optimizations currently;
	- one possible optimization is removing internal List<object> that is allocated for cases when more that 1 continuation is needed,
	  AsyncContinuation can be modified to store a reference to the next continuation object;
