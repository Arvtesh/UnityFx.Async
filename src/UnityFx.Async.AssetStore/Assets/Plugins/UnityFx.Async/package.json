	"displayName": "Asynchronous operations (promises) for Unity",
	"description": "UnityFx.Async introduces effective and portable asynchronous operations that can be used very much like Tasks in .NET or Promises in JS. In many aspects they mimic Task (for example, async/await, continuations and synchronization context capturing) while maintaining Unity/net35 compatibility. It is a great foundation toolset for any Unity project.",
